# Filenames Extractor on Windows
#### Author : Anas Shakeel

## Description:

`Filenames Extractor on Windows` is a program that allows users to extract all files and folder names and paths in a `.txt` file.<br>
Users can give a directory or multiple directories (not yet implemented) and wait for a few seconds and there they go! a text file full with names and paths of all files and folders in those directories.

## Usage / Installation
1. Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/download)
2. Download the code from github to your local machine (PC / Laptop).
3. Extract the `.zip` file
4. Run the program simply by double-clicking `filenames_extractor.py` in file explorer (__recommended__) or by executing `python filenames_extractor.py` in the terminal or command prompt.


## How to use:
> After running the program, you should see a terminal popping up displaying something like this
> ```
> Enter a directory (ctrl+c to exit):
> ```
>
>Now head to the directory from where you want to extract data from and copy it's location (directory path) and paste it in the terminal.
>
> ```
> Enter a directory (ctrl+c to exit): F:\My Files\Wallpapers
> ```
>
> Press `enter` and a message like this should appear
> ```
> Enter a directory (ctrl+c to exit): F:\My Files\Wallpapers
> 
> Extracted data in: F - 'Wallpapers' Files List.txt
> ```
> 
> A `.txt` file should pop up in the folder from where you ran the program.
>
> Open the `.txt` file and there you go!
>
> You can even extract whole partitions by just entering the address.
